# EquationSolver
A program written in Java that, well you guessed it, solves equations

now it can only solve equations without multiplication and with whole numbers only, since this sucks, I'm gonna update this project one day, but for now this is it

If you have any problems running the code here is live demo on repl -> https://replit.com/@EmPiCoder/EquationSolver

if you see any bug, please submit it to the issues page
#How to use
as unknown value use 'x', or else it might not work : ( (Will fix later...)
here's an example of how you can use it -> 3x + 12 = 0, 4x = 23x - 34, 5x - x = 23x + 4, ..., notice how you can't use multiplication, but don't worry, I'll fix this

bye
